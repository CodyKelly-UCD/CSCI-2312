1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip kellyHW1

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        makefile
        Readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd kellyHW1 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./main

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
